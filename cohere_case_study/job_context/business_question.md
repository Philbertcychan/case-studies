# Strategic Case: Cohere's Go-To-Market Expansion

**Context:**  
Cohere is a Canadian frontier AI company that offers LLM APIs and tools. It faces intense competition from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral, all of which have strong U.S. and European footprints.  

**Hypothetical Prompt from Leadership:**  
We’re looking at global expansion and want to evaluate our GTM and pricing approach.

**Key Questions to Answer:**

1. What are the best international markets for Cohere to expand into next?
2. How do our pricing tiers compare to competitors?
3. Are we leaving money on the table in our current enterprise plans?
4. What are the 2–3 most important actions we can take to grow revenue in Q3?
